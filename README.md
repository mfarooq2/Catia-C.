     * Introduction to Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and its components (NameNode, DataNode).  
     * Understanding the Hadoop MapReduce framework.  
     * Hands-on exercises to manipulate data on HDFS using command-line tools.  
   * **PySpark Introduction:**  
     * Setting up PySpark environment and connecting to the Hadoop cluster.  
     * Introduction to PySpark RDDs, DataFrames, and Spark SQL.  
     * Hands-on exercises for data loading, transformation, and aggregation using PySpark.  
3. **Neural Networks & Deep Learning (2-3 Sessions)**  
   * **Neural Network Basics:**  
     * Introduction to the concept of artificial neurons, activation functions, and network architectures.  
     * Explain the fundamental principles of backpropagation and gradient descent.  
   * **Deep Learning with TensorFlow:**  
     * Provide an overview of TensorFlow and its capabilities.  
     * Hands-on implementation of basic neural network models in PyTorch.   
     * Explore common network architectures for different tasks (classification, regression, etc.).  
     * Practice training, validation, and evaluation of neural network models.  
4. **Integrating Hadoop, PySpark, and Neural Networks (2-3 Sessions)**  
   * **Data Preprocessing with PySpark:**  
     * Apply data cleaning, feature engineering, and feature selection techniques using PySpark on the Hadoop cluster.  
     * Develop a robust data pipeline to prepare data for the neural network.  
   * **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
     * Train the selected neural network model using PyTorch on the preprocessed data in PySpark.  
     * Utilize the power of distributed computing in Hadoop for efficient model training.  
     * Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning techniques for optimal model performance.  
   * **Deployment & Visualization (Optional):**  
     * Discuss options for deploying the trained model in a production environment.  
     * Explore visualization tools and techniques to present the project results effectively.  
5. **Project Finalization & Presentation (1 Session)**  
   * **Project Documentation:**  
     * Guide the student in preparing a comprehensive project report covering the methodology, results, and conclusions.  
     * Emphasize the importance of clear explanations and visualizations.  
   * **Project Presentation:**  
     * Practice presenting the project to a hypothetical audience.  
     * Provide feedback on presentation skills and content.  
     * Help the student refine their final presentation.

**Resources:**

* **Online Courses:** Coursera, edX, Udacity, DataCamp  
* **Other Content**: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning\#course-materials  
* **Books:** "Hadoop: The Definitive Guide" by Tom White  
* **Documentation:** Apache Hadoop documentation, PySpark documentation, Tensorflow documentation

**Note:** The number of sessions and specific content can be adjusted based on the student's prior knowledge and the project's complexity. This plan should be tailored to the student's specific needs and interests, with regular feedback and adjustments throughout the process.
